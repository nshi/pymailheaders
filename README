Pymailheaders
=============
Author: Neil Shi <zeegeek@users.sf.net>

Pymailheaders is a small X program which displays mail headers in your mail box.
It was innovated by xmailheaders, with a few more handy features like new mail
highlighting, lauching regardless of network connection status and
auto-reconnecting.  Pymailheaders was written from scratch in Python for
portability and easiness reasons.  Only IMAP4 protocol is supported now.  POP3
support is on the way.

=======

You do not need to install this program, just run pymailheaders.py with
appropriate arguments.


RUN
===
