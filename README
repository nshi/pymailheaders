Pymailheaders
=============
Author: Neil Shi <zeegeek@users.sf.net>

Pymailheaders is a small GTK+ program which displays mail headers in your mail
box.  It was innovated by xmailheaders, with a few more handy features like new
mail highlighting, lauching regardless of network connection status and
auto-reconnecting.  Pymailheaders was written from scratch in Python for
portability and easiness reasons.  IMAP4, POP3 protocols and XML feeds are
supported now.

REQUIREMENTS
============

You need the following packages install on your system in order to run
Pymailheaders,

* Python 2.4 (or above) [http://www.python.org/download/]
* PyGTK 2.6 (or above) [http://pygtk.org/downloads.html]
* GTK 2.6 (or above) [http://gtk.org/download/]


INSTALL
=======

You do not need to install this program, just run pymailheaders.py with
appropriate arguments.


USAGE
=====

Pymailheaders will look for a configuration file called .pymailheadersrc in your
home directory unless you use command line argument '-f' to specify another file
explicitly.  If you do not have a configuration file yet, Pymailheaders will
create one for you in your home directory.  If you already have one, you can
still use command line arguments to overwrite the options in the configuration
file.  If mandatory options like server type, server address, user name and
password are not provided in command line arguments nor in the configuration
file, Pymailheaders will tell you which options are missing.

Use 'pymailheaders.py -h' for full argument list.

On the first time running Pymailheaders, you have to provide all mandatory
options, namely server type, server address, user name and password (if
required), from the command line.

> pymailheaders.py -t imap -s express.cites.uiuc.edu -a -u zeegeek \
  -p classified -e

After successfully launching Pymailheaders, you can omit all arguments except
for '-c' if you use another configuration file in future launches.  Everything
else can be set using Pymailheaders' GTK+ settings dialog by right clicking on
Pymailheaders' window.

> pymailheaders.py

The following demonstrates how to run Pymailheaders for different protocols on command line.

For IMAP4 mailboxes, you need to set server type as imap and provide server URL,
username and password.  If your server supports encrypted connection, you also
have to set the ssl option.  The following example establishes a secured
connection with '-e' argument,

> pymailheaders.py -t imap -s express.cites.uiuc.edu -a -u zeegeek \
  -p classified -e -i 60

To use pymailheaders with POP3 mailbox, it is basically the same as doing it
with IMAP4 mailbox.  The only thing you need to change is server type.  For
example,

> pymailheaders.py -t pop -s express.cites.uiuc.edu -a -u zeegeek \
  -p classified -e -i 60

If you have a Gmail account and you want to check for new mails, just set server
type to feed and server to gmail.  Then you need to give your username and
password.  Here is an example,

> pymailheaders.py -t feed -s gmail -a -u zeegeek -p classified -i 60

You can also use pymailheaders to check for XML feeds in the formats of RSS 1.0,
2.0 and Atom 0.3, 1.0.  If your feed provider does not require authentication,
you do not need to provide username and password.  Example,

> pymailheaders.py -t feed -s http://feedparser.org/docs/examples/atom10.xml

XML feed support is powered by Mark Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser.  It is
included in the package.
