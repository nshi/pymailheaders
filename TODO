*** TODO mbox support
*** TODO clean up error messages

Add verbose flag -v to pymailheaders.py argument list so that detailed error
messages are not shown if this flag is not specified by the user.  In this case,
the user will only see easily understandable error messages in the program
window.  Nothing will be output to standard error.  On the other hand, if this
flag is turned on.  All the detailed error messages will be output to the
standard error.  What will be shown in the program window remains the same as in
the first case.
